         <h1>Hi, my name is Avani Farkade</h1>
           <p>I am going to be a sophomore next year, and the only AP class that I am going to be taking next year, is AP computer science.</p>
           <h3>Another one of my plans next year is to start getting involved outside of school subjects, such as volunteering and attend a lot of after school clubs.</h3>
           <p>Although I have no idea yet what specific college I dream of, or what specifically I want to do in the medical field, I am going to still work hard these remaining three years in highschool so that I can get into a good college.</p>
           <h1>What are my hobbies?</h1>
            <p>My biggest hobby is art, since I love to draw, especially drawing people. I also love to paint too. I also in my free time do knitting since it is relaxing, and I can do it while watching TV and a movie.</p>
